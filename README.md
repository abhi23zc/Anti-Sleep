# Anti Sleep Machine Learning web app projet 



# Description: 
Developed a machine 
learning application that uses face 
recognition to monitor a user's face and 
triggers an alarm when it detects that the 
user is sleeping. 

# Technologies Used: 
Python, OpenCV, 
Haar Cascade Classifier 

# Key Features: 
# Real-Time Face Detection: 
Continuously 
scans and identifies the user's face using the 
Haar Cascade algorithm. 
# Sleep Detection: 
Monitors eye closure 
and other facial cues to determine if the 
user is asleep. 
# Alarm System: 
Triggers an audible alarm 
to wake the user when sleep is detected.
